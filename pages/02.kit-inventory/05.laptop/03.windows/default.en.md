title: Windows

Although proprietary, this operating system is widely used, as it deserves to be.  Certain applications do not exist on Linux, particularly games.

## Installation

The computers are pre-installed with Windows.  

The configuration is easily customizable (wallpaper, etc...), and programs are already installed.

## User Accounts

The principal session is the `ideasbox` session.  It gives you administrative rights.

## Programs and Software

Just like with Ubuntu, a selection of programs are installed.

They include: vlc, skype, firefox, chrome, 7zip, teamviewer, blender, freecad, gimp, libreoffice, scratch, tuxpaint, sumatrapdf, flashplayer, audacity, calibre, dotnetfx , freemind , inkscape, picasa, scribus, sketchup et xmind.

We try to remove applications that are installed as trial versions, as they will expire quickly anyway.
