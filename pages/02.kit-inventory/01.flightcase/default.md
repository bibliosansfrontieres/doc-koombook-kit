The flightcase is built with POLYTCASE® technology.

> The POLYTCASE® is composed of 10mm-thick honeycomb polycarbonate panels instead of the 5 layers of betonnex or laminated plywood traditionally used.
> Polycarbonate panels are glued in double interlocking aluminum angles. Traditional plywood products are usually simply nailed or stapled. Riveted corners increase the visual appeal of the case. 
> 
> POLYTCASES® are also up to 3 times lighter than traditional cases, ensuring savings on transportation, particularly by air.
