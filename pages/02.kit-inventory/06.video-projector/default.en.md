There are two types of video projectors available depending on your needs.

## Light & Portable

Projector with built-in battery (~4 hours) and RGB LED light (around 250 lumens).

This type of projector can cover basic needs and show content to a small group of people. For best results, the room must be dark.

## Bigger & Brighter

For other needs, the bigger projector delivers brighter and higher quality images (3200 lumens).  It relies on the main power supply and canâ€™t run on battery.

This equipment is especially handy for class, movies, etc.
